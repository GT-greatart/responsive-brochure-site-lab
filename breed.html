                        <p class="pBreed">
                            The Lhasa Apso is an ancient breed, developed in Tibet from the Tibetan terrier and similar herding-type Tibetan dogs. The conversion of Tibet to Buddhism in the 7th century AD established the Lhasa Apso as a definitive breed. Buddha is said to have had
                            power over lions, and the Lhasa Apso with its full coat, full head of hair and leonine colors was referred to as "the lion dog."
                        </p>
                        <p class="pBreed">Lamas (Tibetan priests) are reputed to be reincarnated as Lhasa Apsos if they do not reach Nirvana. The Dalai Lamas not only kept Lhasa Apsos as pets, but also used them as gifts for honored guests. Lhasa Apsos sent to China were
                            used in the development of the Shih Tzu and Pekingese breeds. Lhasa Apsos not only served as pets and companions but also as guard dogs because of their alert nature and their sharp bark.
                        </p>

                        <div>
                            <p class="pBreed">When the Lhasa Apso first reached Europe and North America, confusion resulted in interbreeding with the Shih Tzu and possibly Tibetan terrier. By 1930 however, the breeds were being separated and distinguishing standards written
                                up.

                        <h2 class="h2Breed ">Personality</h2>
                        <p class="pBreed">It should be remembered at all times that the Lhasa Apso was bred as a guard dog as well as a companion dog. These dogs can be aloof with strangers, although they are affectionate with people who they know and trust. The sharp
                            alarm bark can become a nuisance if the dog is not guided as to when it is appropriate.</p>
                        <p class="pBreed">Lhasa Apsos are dogs that do best with a fair amount of socialization and plenty of human company. They are not always good with other dogs, so they should be socialized to dogs and other pets as well as people right from puppy
                            hood. Some Lhasa Apsos have a suspicious nature and can be snippy. At home with family and friends, however, they are lively and can be almost silly.</p>

                        <p class="pBreed">
                            Lhasa Apsos are "easy keepers;" too many treats or not enough exercise can easily lead to obesity. Luckily because of their small size, a regular walk two or three times a day is adequate. Lhasa Apsos are intelligent dogs, but they are a bit stubborn
                            and independent, so training is a must. A firm but patient hand works best.
                        </p>
                        <p class="pBreed">Lhasa Apsos should be well socialized to both people and other animals, including other dogs, in puppy hood. They are excellent watchdogs with a sharp, loud alarm bark. Lhasa Apsos can do well with children, but they should be
                            supervised and exposed to them early on. These are notoriously long-lived dogs, routinely going into their late teens. The record holder is a breed champion who lived to 29 years of age!
